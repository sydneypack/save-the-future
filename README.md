A world of change, a world without pollution more so air pollution, a world without respiratory diseases due to toxic air , we all need such a world.

INTRODUCTION

I am Nambasa Dorcus Belinda and with great concern am here to unveil the greatest environmental destroyer and cause of most negative health conditions.

With great desire and hope to live in a pollution and disease free world, we, humans are coming up with different ways of conserving the environment order to make it a better place. Implementing various ways of fighting water, land and air pollution, humanity comes up with advanced methods of taking action to reduce these kinds of pollution. Pollution does not only affect the environment we live in but also affects our health and lifestyles. The main type of pollution we are going to look at is Air pollution.

Air pollution is the introduction of toxic/harmful gases into the atmosphere. This affects our health more so acute and chronic respiratory diseases, causes global warming, heart diseases, Neuropsychiatric complications, and so many other environmental damages as talked about in the findings below.

FINDINGS

**ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLICATIONS GLOBAL WARMING AND GREENHOUSE EFFECT**

**GREENHOUSE EFFECT** 

The greenhouse effect is the process by which greenhouse gases(carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide) in a planet's atmosphere cause some of the heat radiated from the planet's surface to build up within the planet's surface.

These gases rise up in the atmosphere forming a thermal blanket(heat trap) that traps heat radiated by the earth's surface from ecsaping the earth's surfeace. When the sun radiates heat, a lot of solar radiations enter the earth's atmosphere to the surface causing a short wave length and the surface of the earth radiates less heat back and when it rises, trying to find its way out of the earth's atmosphere, it is trapped by the thermal blanket formed by the greenhouse gases and this surface radiation has a long wavelength because it has low temperatures compared to the radiations from the sun.

These gases have a mechanism of absorbing heat and since the gas molecules are loosely held together causing them to vibrate after absorbing heat hence transferrring heat to nearby greenhouse molecules, some heat escapes out of the atmosphere and more of the heat back to the surface. This continuous process will keep the planet warm hence causing global warming.

Global warming

What is global warming and its cause?

Global warming is an aspect of climate change, referring to the long-term rise of the planet's temperatures. It is caused by increased concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, mainly from human activities such as burning fossil fuels, and farming. Global warming has effects on our environment and these include: Hotter temperatures. As greenhouse gas concentrations rise, so does the global surface temperature. ... More severe storms. ... Increased drought. ... A warming, rising ocean. ... Loss of species. ... Not enough food. ... More health risks. ... Poverty and displacement

Acid Rain Harms Forests Acid rain can be extremely harmful to forests. Acid rain that seeps into the ground can dissolve nutrients, such as magnesium and calcium, that trees need to be healthy. Acid rain also causes aluminum to be released into the soil, which makes it difficult for trees to take up water. Trees that are located in mountainous regions at higher elevations, such as spruce or fir trees, are at greater risk because they are exposed to acidic clouds and fog, which contain greater amounts of acid than rain or snow. The acidic clouds and fog strip important nutrients from their leaves and needles. This loss of nutrients makes it easier for infections, insects, and cold weather to damage trees and forests.

Acid Rain Damages Lakes and Streams Without pollution or acid rain, most lakes and streams would have a pH level near 6.5. Acid rain, however, has caused many lakes and streams in the northeast United States and certain other places to have much lower pH levels. In addition, aluminum that is released into the soil eventually ends up in lakes and streams. Unfortunately, this increase in acidity and aluminum levels can be deadly to aquatic wildlife, including phytoplankton, mayflies, rainbow trout, small mouth bass, frogs, spotted salamanders, crayfish, and other creatures that are part of the food web.

This problem can become much worse during heavy downpours of rain or when the snow begins to melt in the spring. These types of events are known as episodic acidification.

Acid Rain Damages Buildings and Objects Acid rain can also have a damaging effect on many objects, including buildings, statues, monuments, and cars. The chemicals found in acid rain can cause paint to peel and stone statues to begin to appear old and worn down, which reduces their value and beauty.

**GENERAL CAUSES OF POLLUTION AND GLOBAL WARMING.**

 The Burning of Fossil Fuels
 
 Industrial Emission of poisonous fumes such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide,etc
 
 Wildfires due to climate change 
 
 Transprotation such as fuel taking vehicles release carbon monoxide
 
 Open Burning of Garbage Waste, etc

**FIGHTING POLLUTION AND SAVING UGANDA AND THE WORLD AT LARGE.** IT ALL STARTS WITH US!!

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), people in Uganda are more likely to die from air pollution than those in Tanzania, Rwanda, and twice as likely as those in Kenya. The burden of disease (mortality and morbidity) attributable to air pollution in the country has been on the rise in recent years, with Kampala, Uganda's capital, having the second worst air in Africa, according to the AirVisual's 2018 World Air Quality Report. More precisely, the mortality rate for air pollution in Uganda was 155.7 for every 100,000 in 2016.

There are various sources of pollution in Uganda including those due to agricultural, industrial, and municipal waste discharges, dumping, and e-waste. The waste pollutes and alters fragile ecological systems and causes bio-accumulation and bio-concentration of harmful chemicals in organisms, which poses a grave threat to human livelihood.

CONTROL MEASURES TO TAKE IN ORDER TO REDUCE POLLUTION IN UGANDA.

MISSION ONE

Under Uganda’s Vision 2040, the environment and waste management are pledged to be emphasized in line with the integrated physical planning models. This will entail strict control of pollution, wetland management, waste management and promotion and protection of green areas, open spaces and corridors. At the same time, over the Vision 2040 periodical efforts will be undertaken to attain a green and clean environment with no water and air pollution while conserving the flora and fauna and restoring and adding value to the ecosystems [8].
